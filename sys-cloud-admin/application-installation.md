# Application Installation

Install **any one** of the below applications on a Ubuntu 18.04 Server. Installation needs to be done manually, and not using any readymade image. 

- Laravel on PHP 7.3 + NGINX + MySQL 5.7
- Joomla 3.9 on PHP 7.3 + NGINX + MySQL 5.7
- Redmine 4 

You can do the installation on any cloud VM if you have access to. Alternately you can set up Virtualbox on your laptop and set up a Ubuntu VM inside. 

Send us a screenshot of the respective application pages once installed. Also, do not destroy this installation. You may need to use it during the interview.
