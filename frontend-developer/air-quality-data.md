# Display air quality data

Use the Real time Air Quality Index API from https://data.gov.in/resources/real-time-air-quality-index-various-locations/api and create a page that shows the air quality for a chosen city. 

Use your imagination to create a simple and easy to use interface. You are free to use any JavaScript and CSS framework of your choice. 

Once done, send us a zip file of the assignment for evaluation. Would be even better if you can host it somewhere and just send a link to us.
